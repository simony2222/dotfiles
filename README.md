# dotfiles
Those are my custom dotfiles

## custom git
I followed [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). Except I left `status.showUntrackedFiles` to it's default value (I think it's `normal`) and I used the name `dotfiles` instead of `config`.

That means that one has to use `dotfiles` as a key word istead of `git` to access to the git fonctionnalities.
